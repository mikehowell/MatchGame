# MatchGame

MatchGame is the first WPF example from [Head First C# Fourt Edition](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition).

Additionally, I created MatchGame2.0 to code up what I thought the MatchGame was going to be i.e. a [card memory game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)).
